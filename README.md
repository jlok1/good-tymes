## Inspiration
Activities are very important to the human body, but with the progress of the times, many young people are working hard and forget the importance of sports. Their health is getting worse day by day.  Health Research (RISKESDAS) in 2018 showed that Indonesians who lack physical activity increased from 26.1% in 2013 to 33.5% in 2018. DKI Jakarta has the highest case which is up to 44.2% of people reported being less active. In 2019 a study conducted by Abadinni and Wuryaningsih found that the figure of office workers in Jakarta lacking physical activity will increase to 59% in 2019.

To address this problem, our team, Dream Team, plans to develop a mobile application using Flutter that will have few features to help senior citizens join different kinds of activities. For example, senior citizens can use our app to view available activity posted by other users near them and obtain crowdsourced activity information such as location, time, date and etc. Another feature is to let senior citizens create their own activity to let other people join their activity, based on their preferences.

## What it does
As soon as the user logs into the app using their Google account, GoodTymes will be ready to serve them. If the user would like to make their own activity and gather participants for it, they can do so by setting a location, date, time and maximum number of participants. If the user has previously signed up for at least one activity, GoodTymes will let them view the particulars of the said activity so this would be useful for them to keep track of all the activities. Finally, GoodTymes also supports different languages which includes English, Indonesian and Mandarin.

## How we built it
GoodTymes is being developed using the Flutter Framework. The front end development is done solely using Flutter while the back end of the application works closely with Firebase. Since GoodTymes possesses the integration of mobile-friendly interactive maps, Leaflet JS library is also included as a part of the back end development. Finally, Nominatim - a web API to obtain coordinates from a particular place and vice versa is being implemented. 

## Challenges we ran into
The challenge we run into is time constraint. At first our team needs to discuss what we are going to create in these 48 hours. We can not think of some idea that is hard to make it also cranky, so we need to figure out which function is good for our application and also help those citizens. After that we discussed which software kit development we were going to use for our project and which software we were going to use for our backend. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team has accomplished a fully workable application with a nice interface, documentation and videos within 48 hours.

## What we learned
The first thing we learn is called teamwork. With a strong team, it helps us to manage our time well. We learned that allocating appropriate time for documentation, application, and preparing a video within 48 hours were challenging. We are required to have strong time management skills to segregate our tasks appropriately. 

## What's next for GoodTymes
For further enhancements to our applications we will try to add a function based on the history activity joined by the user to come up with a way to derive and suggest or bookmark the favorite activity for the user. If there is any similar activity to the user's favorites, then the app will be triggered and will send a notification to the user to prompt the user with the activity details. We will also add a function called Spatial crowdsourcing, which is to let senior citizens share time and efforts in doing quality activities together. This function is to help each other spend quality time, ensure good mental state, prevent loneliness, and make new friends.
